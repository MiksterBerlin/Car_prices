What factors influence the price of a car

The demand for used cars is constantly increasing. With the higher demand the industry is growing. Understanding important factors that influence the pricing of these vehicles is essential for buyers, dealerships and financial institutions. Especially, age, mileage, and brand are commonly used to determine the price.
Having better models that can easily gage the sales value of a specific vehicle helps with several things.

1: Informed estimates strengthen confidence during negotiation for byer and seller.
2. Helps dealers price inventory competitively based on demand and depreciation trends.
3. Automated Pricing on sites like CarMax, and Kelley Blue Book to suggest real-time prices.
4. Banks use predicted car values to assess loan amounts and risks.
